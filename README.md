### [Description](#table-of-contents)
In this application I made a techblog that utilized the MVC file structure. I connected all the routes in order to allow the user to Post, Edit, Delete, and Comment. 
I used the Handlebars template engine in order to dynamically generate the page based on the user's interaction. You should only be able to interact with the page when logged in, 
otherwise the only option will be to view the posts and comments. 



### [Installation](#table-of-contents)
Please either clone the repository or download the zip file from my personal github. Once finished, please install all the dependencies for this application. 
You can start the application by either running "npm start" or "npm run watch" from the terminal. 



### [Usage](#table-of-contents)
When first viewing the site you will be directed to the homepage. On the homepage you will only be able to view posts, unless you are logged in. Please log in to be able to interact with the website. If you do not wish to create an account, there will be login info in the userseeds.json file that you may use. once logged in you should be able to follow the user interface to do any posting, commenting, editing, or deleting.
